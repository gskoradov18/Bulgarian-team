            <h2 class="font-weight-bolds" data-lang="Title1">What is Blue Economy ?</h2>
            <p class="text-justify" data-lang="Text1">According to the World Bank, the blue economy is the "sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving the health of ocean ecosystem."
                European Commission defines it as "All economic activities related to oceans, seas and coasts. It covers a wide range of interlinked established and emerging sectors."
                The Commonwealth of Nations considers it "an emerging concept which encourages better stewardship of our ocean or 'blue' resources."
                Conservation International adds that "blue economy also includes economic benefits that may not be marketed, such as carbon storage, coastal protection, cultural values and biodiversity."
                The Center for the Blue Economy says "it is now a widely used term around the world with three related but distinct meanings- the overall contribution of the oceans to economies, the need to address the environmental and ecological sustainability of the oceans, and the ocean economy as a growth opportunity for both developed and developing countries."

                <h2 class="font-weight-bolds" data-lang="Title2">Why The Blue Economy ?</h2>
                <p class="text-justify"data-lang="Text2"> Put
                    simply, the blue economy is the sustainable
                    and integrated development of economic
                    sectors in healthy oceans. The driving principle
                    behind the concept is that oceanic sectors
                    are inextricably interlinked and cannot be
                    considered in isolation. Preserving the health
                    of oceans and defending the livelihoods, food
                    security, and well-being of all who depend upon
                    them is contingent on a thoughtful, strategic
                    approach—a blue economy approach—to the
                    development of economic activities that rely on
                    or affect oceans. Adopting a blue economy lens enables the
                    World Bank and its partners to propose
                    optimal development strategies for countries
                    that depend on clean oceans for growth, jobs,
                    and food. These strategies rely on thorough
                    diagnostic analyses.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-weight-bolds"data-lang="Title3">What is The Challenge ?</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify"data-lang="Text3">Marine resources, both coastal and oceanic,
                        provide irreplaceable benefits and services
                        that align with the World Bank Group’s twin
                        goals of eliminating extreme poverty and
                        boosting shared prosperity.However, oceans are in crisis: marine pollution
                        and plastic litter, along with the growing
                        impacts of climate change, endanger marine
                        ecosystems, the health of coastal communities,
                        and the resources and services that drive
                        growth. Furthermore, growing demand
                        for oceanic and land-based resources may
                        worsen existing overexploitation of ocean
                        resources and services while increasing plastic
                        consumption and litter flows. Without a
                        coordinated response, these threats will further
                        deplete fisheries (of which over 30 percent are
                        overfished), destroy coastal wetlands, and cause
                        pernicious effects on the natural assets that
                        attract tourism to coastal communities. These
                        challenges are exacerbated by governance
                        problems, especially in areas beyond national
                        jurisdiction, and usage conflicts among sectors,
                        which can be resolved only through improved
                        and better integrated management.</p>
