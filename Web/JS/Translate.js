        като същевременно се запазва здравето на океанската екосистема“. Европейската комисия го определя като „Всички икономически дейности, свързани с океаните, моретата и бреговете.
        Тя обхваща широк спектър от взаимосвързани установени и нововъзникващи сектори“. Общността на народите счита, че това е „възникваща концепция, която насърчава 
        по-доброто управление на нашите океански или„ сини “ресурси“. Conservation International добавя, че „синята икономика включва и икономически ползи, 
        които може да не се предлагат на пазара, като съхранение на въглерод, крайбрежна защита, културни ценности и биоразнообразие“. Центърът за синята икономика казва, 
        че  това е широко използван термин по целия свят с три свързани, но различни значения - цялостният принос на океаните за икономиките, необходимостта от справяне с екологичната 
        и екологичната устойчивост на океаните и океана икономиката като възможност за растеж както за развитите, така и за развиващите се страни. ` ,

        en: `According to the World Bank, the blue economy is "the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving 
        the health of ocean ecosystem". European Commission defines it as "All economic activities related to oceans, seas and coasts. It covers a wide range of interlinked 
        established and emerging sectors". The Commonwealth of Nations considers it an "emerging concept" which encourages better stewardship of our ocean or 'blue' "resources". 
        Conservation International adds that "blue economy also includes economic benefits that may not be marketed, such as carbon storage, coastal protection, cultural values and 
        biodiversity". The Center for the Blue Economy says it is now a widely used term around the world with three related but distinct meanings- the overall contribution of the 
        oceans to economies, the need to address the environmental and ecological sustainability of the oceans, and the ocean economy as a growth opportunity for both developed and
        developing countries.`,

        bg: `Казано по-просто, синята икономика е устойчивото и интегрирано развитие на икономическите сектори в здравите океани. Основният принцип на концепцията е, 
        че океанските сектори са неразривно свързани и не могат да се разглеждат изолирано. Опазването на здравето на океаните и защита на поминъка, продоволствената сигурност и 
        благополучието на всички, които зависят от тях, зависи от обмислен стратегически подход - подход на синята икономика - за развитието на икономически дейности, които разчитат 
        или влияят на океаните. Приемане на обектива синя икономика позволява на Световната банка и нейните партньори да предложи оптимални стратегии за развитие за страните, 
        които зависят от чисти океани за растеж, работни места и храна. Тези стратегии разчитат на задълбочени диагностични анализи.` ,

        en: `Put simply, the blue economy is the sustainable and integrated development of economic sectors in healthy oceans. 
        The driving principle behind the concept is that oceanic sectors are inextricably interlinked and cannot be considered in isolation. 
        Preserving the health of oceans and defending the livelihoods, food security, and well-being of all who depend upon them is contingent on a thoughtful, 
        strategic approach—a blue economy approach—to the development of economic activities that rely on or affect oceans. Adopting a blue economy lens enables 
        the World Bank and its partners to propose optimal development strategies for countries that depend on clean oceans for growth, jobs, and food. 
        These strategies rely on thorough diagnostic analyses.`,

        нарастващото въздействие на изменението на климата, застрашават морските екосистеми, здравето на крайбрежните общности и ресурсите и услугите, които водят до растеж.

        may worsen existing overexploitation of ocean resources and services while increasing plastic consumption and litter flows. Without a coordinated response, these threats 
        will further deplete fisheries (of which over 30 percent are overfished), destroy coastal wetlands, and cause pernicious effects on the natural assets that attract tourism 
        to coastal communities. These challenges are exacerbated by governance problems, especially in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and usage conflicts among sectors,
